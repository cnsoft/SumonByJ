## Sumon (formerly MathMayhem) ##

Sumon is the CAAT based game.
As a technical demonstration, the aim of this game is to show how to develop games with the CAAT framework.
Nothing in this game pops-in, and the intention is to make extensive use of behaviors to make smooth transitions
on every game aspect.

This game renders gracefully on Canvas, WebGL and CSS.
